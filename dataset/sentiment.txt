All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.|Negative
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.|Positive
Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.|Positive
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.|Positive
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.|Negative
I am glad I purchased it.|Positive
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.|Negative
Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.|Negative
Don't buy this product.|Negative
sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.|Negative
No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.|Positive
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.|Negative
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.|Negative
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.|Negative
I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.|Positive
I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.|Positive
Thank you for such great service.|Positive
Its a total package.|Positive
The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.|Positive
I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.|Negative
It's AGGRAVATING!|Negative
Great product for the price!.|Positive
I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use|Positive
Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!|Positive
None of it works, just don't buy it.|Negative
Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.|Negative
Please dont waste your money.|Negative
All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.|Positive
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.|Negative
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.|Negative
Disapointing Results.|Negative
Cumbersome design.|Negative
Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!|Positive
Great Product.|Positive
It's A PIECE OF CRAP!|Negative
My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!|Negative
This fixes all the problems.|Positive
Worst ever.|Negative
I am very happy|Positive
I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.|Positive
I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying "what?"|Negative
The battery life is highly unacceptable.|Negative
That company is a joke.|Negative
It does everything the description said it would.|Positive
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.|Negative
It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.|Positive
Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.|Negative
Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.|Negative
It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.|Positive
Better than expected.|Positive
It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.|Negative
Battery is holding up well.|Positive
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.|Negative
I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.|Negative
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.|Negative
Sprint - terrible customer service.|Negative

Better Than New.|Positive
What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...|Negative
Piece of trash.|Negative
A pretty good product.|Positive
This is a great phone!.|Positive
For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.|Positive
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.|Positive
The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.|Negative
Those phones are working just fine now.|Positive
I am more than happy with this product.|Positive
Poor Construction.|Negative
This is infuriating.|Negative
Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.|Positive
Sprint charges for this service.|Negative
It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.|Negative
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.|Positive
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.|Negative
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.|Positive
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.|Positive
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.|Positive
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.|Negative
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.|Negative
Poor product.|Negative
However I needed some better instructions.|Negative
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.|Negative
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).|Positive
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.|Negative
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS|Negative
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.|Positive
Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.|Negative
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.|Positive
Very Dissapointing Performance.|Negative
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.|Negative
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.|Negative
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.|Negative
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.|Positive
Don't bother - go to the store.|Negative
I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!|Positive
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.|Positive
You get what you pay for I guess.|Negative
Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.|Positive
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.|Positive
These are fabulous!|Positive
However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.|Negative
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.|Positive
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.|Negative
Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.|Negative
Very wind-resistant.|Positive
Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.|Negative
They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.|Positive
I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.|Negative
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!|Negative
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.|Positive
Great phone.|Positive
When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.|Negative
I'm pleased.|Positive
Battery is terrible.|Negative
I found the product to be easy to set up and use.|Positive
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.|Negative
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.|Negative
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.|Negative
No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.|Positive
Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.|Negative
The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.|Positive
Talk about USELESS customer service.|Negative
It felt too light and "tinny.".|Negative
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.|Negative
I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.|Positive
I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.|Positive
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.|Positive
Does everything it should and more.|Positive
I could not recommend these more.|Negative
Nice Sound.|Positive
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!|Negative
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.|Positive
Setup went very smoothly.|Positive
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.|Negative
A must study for anyone interested in the "worst sins" of industrial design.|Negative
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.|Negative
It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.|Positive
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.|Negative
Can't upload ringtones from a third party.|Negative
Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.|Negative
Truly awful.|Negative
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.|Positive
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).|Positive
And none of the tones is acceptable.|Negative
camera color balance is AWFUL.|Negative
This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.|Negative
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!|Positive
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.|Negative
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.|Positive
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.|Negative
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.|Negative
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!|Negative
Works well.|Positive
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.|Negative
Clear crisp sound.|Positive
I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.|Positive
The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.|Negative
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.|Negative
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.|Negative
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.|Positive
It doesn't make you look cool.|Negative
Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.|Positive
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.|Positive
Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.|Negative
You can't beat the price on these.|Positive
* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!|Positive
lightweight and works well.|Positive
So just beware.|Negative
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.|Positive
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.|Negative
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.|Positive
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.|Negative
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.|Positive
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.|Negative
It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.|Negative
Poor quality.|Negative
jabra ear gels "R" the best!.|Positive
Not worth it.|Negative
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.|Negative
It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.|Positive
Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).|Negative
It was a great phone.|Positive
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.|Negative
Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.|Positive
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.|Positive
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!|Positive
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!|Negative
In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim "Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?|Positive
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.|Positive
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.|Positive
Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.|Positive
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.|Positive
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.|Negative
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.|Positive
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.|Negative
T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.|Positive
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.|Positive
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros|Negative
Provides good protection and looks classy, too.|Positive
Krussel Always good.|Positive
The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.|Positive
The design is very good.4.|Positive

I would highly recommend this product.|Positive
Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!|Negative
It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.|Negative
Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.|Negative
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!|Negative
Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is|Positive
stay away from this store, be careful.|Negative
This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.|Positive
Does not fit.|Negative
.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.|Positive
It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.|Positive
disappointing.|Negative
Blue Ant is easy to use.|Positive
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.|Positive
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.|Negative
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.|Negative
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.|Positive
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.|Negative
The sound quality is excellent as well.|Positive
Its the best headset I have used.|Positive
Would not reccommend.|Negative
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.|Positive
Just what I wanted.|Positive
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.|Negative
wont work right or atleast for me.|Negative
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.|Negative
But now that it is "out of warranty" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.|Negative
I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good|Negative
Great product.|Positive
Crisp and Clear.|Positive
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.|Negative
VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.|Negative
I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.|Negative
The reception has been generally good.|Positive
Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.|Positive
Great bluetooth!.|Positive
I highly recommend this case.|Positive
WORTHWHILE.|Positive
This is a great deal.|Positive
After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.|Negative
I am sorry I made this purchase.|Negative
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.|Negative
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.|Negative
It was horrible!.|Negative
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.|Negative
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.|Negative
They work about 2 weeks then break.|Negative
It is simple to use and I like it.|Positive
It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!|Positive
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.|Negative
NOT WHAT I WANTED.|Negative
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.|Positive
Great Phone.|Positive
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.|Positive
The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.|Negative
Perfect for the PS3.|Positive
Five star Plus, plus.|Positive

$50 Down the drain.|Negative
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.|Negative
Good , works fine.|Positive
For the price this was a great deal.|Positive
Great price, too!|Positive
If there is a wind, it is completely useless.|Negative
Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!|Positive
Does Not Work.|Negative
At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).|Negative
The reception through this headset is excellent.|Positive
2 thumbs up to this seller|Positive
I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.|Positive
Improper description.... I had to return it.|Negative
#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.|Positive
Battery charge-life is quite long.|Positive
The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.|Positive
Battery has no life.|Negative
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.|Negative
Product is exactly as described.|Positive
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.|Positive
Doesn't do the job.|Negative
I would recommend it.|Positive
Plan on ordering from them again and again.|Positive
That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.|Positive
I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.|Positive
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).|Positive
Awkward to use and unreliable.|Negative
The shipping time was also very quick!|Positive
Not as good as I had hoped.|Negative
Good case!.|Positive
Doesn't Work.|Negative
Really good product.|Positive
Unfortunately it did not work.|Negative
All three broke within two months of use.|Negative
dont buy it.|Negative
My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.|Negative
However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.|Negative
The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.|Negative
Horrible, horrible protector.|Negative
I don't like this Nokia either.|Negative
Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.|Negative
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.|Negative
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.|Negative
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!|Negative
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.|Negative
Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.|Negative
It's not what it says it is.|Negative
Stay Away From the Q!.|Negative
Used and dirty.|Negative
Very unreliable service from T-mobile !|Negative
Not good enough for the price.|Negative
I bought two of them and neither will charge.|Negative
It looks very nice.|Positive
This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.|Positive
I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.|Positive
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.|Negative
Comfortable in my hand.|Positive
Just does not work.|Negative
Poor Reliability.|Negative
(It works!)|Positive
If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.|Negative
Terrible product, and waste of money!|Negative
Last time buying from you.|Negative
It was a waste of my money.|Negative
So far it has worked like a charm.|Positive
I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.|Positive
But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.|Positive
Would recommend this item.|Positive
It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.|Positive
Nice case, feels good in your hands.|Positive

My sister has one also and she loves it.|Positive
Good Quality.|Positive
This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.|Negative
Excellent dual-purpose headset.|Positive
Excellent!.|Positive
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.|Negative
It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.|Positive
The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.|Negative
Having trouble with volume.|Negative
The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.|Positive
WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.|Negative
I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.|Positive
When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.|Negative
I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.|Negative
Best headset ever!!!.|Positive
Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.|Negative
It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.|Positive
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.|Negative
Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.|Positive
Excellent product for the price.|Positive
Bad Reception.|Negative
This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!|Negative
It was quite comfortable in the ear.|Positive
Great phone.|Positive
Don't buy this product - It fails!.|Negative
Everything about this product is wrong.First|Negative
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.|Positive
This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.|Negative
Terrible phone holder.|Negative
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.|Positive
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.|Positive
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.|Negative
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.|Negative
But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.|Positive
How stupid is that?|Negative
I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.|Positive
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.|Positive
Good show, Samsung.|Positive
So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.|Positive
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.|Negative
Couldn't figure it out|Negative
My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.|Negative
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.|Negative
While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.|Negative
Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.|Positive
Works for me.|Positive
Saggy, floppy piece of junk.|Negative
much better than the hard plastic cases.|Positive
It also had a new problem.|Negative
Happy so far!.|Positive
cool phone.|Positive
Works good.|Positive
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.|Positive
It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.|Negative
but it is great, i would really recommend it|Positive
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.|Negative
As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!|Negative
Never got it!!!!!|Negative
This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.|Negative
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!|Negative
Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.|Negative
You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."|Positive
However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.|Negative
I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.|Negative
The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.|Positive
Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.|Positive
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.|Positive
A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.|Positive
I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.|Positive
The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.|Negative
I'm returning them.|Negative
I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.|Negative
It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.|Positive
I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.|Positive
Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.|Positive
nice leather.|Positive
I had to purchase a different case.|Negative
It is a joy to use.|Positive
Very much disappointed with this company.|Negative
Very satisifed with that.|Positive
It didn't charge for me.|Negative
This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!|Positive
Buttons are too small.|Negative
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.|Positive
Love it.. Great armband.|Positive
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.|Positive
However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.|Negative
I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.|Positive
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.|Positive
Also makes it easier to hold on to.|Positive
I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!|Positive
It's pretty easy.|Positive
I cannot make calls at certain places.|Negative
however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.|Negative
Beautiful styling though.|Positive
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.|Negative

This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.|Negative
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.|Positive
SWEETEST PHONE!!!|Positive
:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.|Positive
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.|Positive
Not enough volume.|Negative
Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory|Negative
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.|Negative
don't waste your money.|Negative
I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.|Negative
Adapter does not provide enough charging current.|Negative
There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.|Negative
You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.|Negative
Phone falls out easily.|Negative
It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk.|Negative
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.|Negative
I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.|Negative
Painful on the ear.|Negative
Lasted one day and then blew up.|Negative
disappointed.|Negative
Kind of flops around.|Negative
The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.|Negative
What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.|Negative
Item Does Not Match Picture.|Negative
The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).|Negative
You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!|Negative
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  |Negative
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  |Negative
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  |Negative
Very little music or anything to speak of.  |Negative
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  |Positive
The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  |Negative
Wasted two hours.  |Negative
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  |Positive
A bit predictable.  |Negative
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  |Positive
And those baby owls were adorable.  |Positive
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  |Positive
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  |Positive
It Was So Cool.  |Positive
This is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  |Positive
It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  |Negative
This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  |Positive
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  |Positive
It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces.  |Positive
" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  |Positive
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  |Positive
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  |Positive
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  |Positive
It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  |Positive
Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  |Positive
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  |Negative
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  |Negative
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  |Positive
It deserves strong love.  |Positive
It is an insane game.  |Positive
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  |Positive
Waste your money on this game.  |Positive
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  |Positive
Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  |Positive
Today the graphics are crap.  |Negative
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  |Positive
This game rocks.  |Positive
Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  |Positive
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  |Positive
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  |Negative
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  |Negative
I wasn't the least bit interested.  |Negative
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  |Negative
But it's just not funny.  |Negative
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  |Negative
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  |Negative
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  |Negative
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  |Negative
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  |Negative
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  |Positive
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  |Positive
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  |Positive
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  |Positive
On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  |Negative
Long, whiny and pointless.  |Negative
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  |Negative
Excellent cast, story line, performances.  |Positive
Totally believable.  |Positive
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  |Positive
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  |Positive
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  |Positive
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  |Positive
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  |Positive
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  |Positive
I was very disappointed in the movie.  |Negative
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  |Negative
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  |Negative
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  |Negative
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  |Negative
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  |Negative
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  |Negative
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  |Negative
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  |Negative
There are some generally great things in it.  |Positive
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  |Negative
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  |Positive
I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  |Positive
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  |Positive
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  |Positive
He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  |Positive
I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of Québec.  |Negative
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  |Positive
If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  |Positive
Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  |Positive
Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  |Positive
Give this one a look.  |Positive
I gave it a 10  |Positive
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  |Positive
It is a true classic.  |Positive
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  |Positive
Definitely worth checking out.  |Positive
The problem was the script.  |Negative
It was horrendous.  |Negative
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  |Negative
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  |Negative
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  |Positive
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  |Positive
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  |Positive
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  |Positive
If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  |Positive
I don't think you will be disappointed.  |Positive
Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  |Negative
The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  |Negative
It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  |Negative
Too politically correct.  |Negative
Very disappointing.  |Negative
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  |Positive
I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  |Negative
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  |Negative
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  |Positive
The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  |Positive
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  |Negative
The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  |Negative
), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  |Negative
The directing seems too pretentious.  |Negative
The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  |Negative
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  |Negative
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  |Negative
Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however.  |Positive
I really liked that.  |Positive
A great film by a great director.  |Positive
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  |Positive
The music in the film is really nice too.  |Positive
I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  |Positive
Brilliant!  |Positive
10/10  |Positive
I liked this movie way too much.  |Positive
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  |Negative
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  |Positive
However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  |Negative
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  |Negative
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  |Negative
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  |Negative
All in all, a great disappointment.  |Negative
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".  |Negative
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  |Negative
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  |Negative
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  |Negative
I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  |Negative
Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  |Negative
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  |Negative
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  |Negative
It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  |Negative
You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  |Negative
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  |Positive
This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  |Negative
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  |Negative
A truly, truly bad film.  |Negative
The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  |Negative
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  |Negative
I paid too much.  |Negative
Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  |Positive
It was so BORING!  |Negative
No plot whatsoever!  |Negative
Again, no plot at all.  |Negative
Horrible!  |Negative
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  |Negative
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  |Negative
I hate movies like that.  |Negative
Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  |Negative
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  |Negative
If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  |Negative
Awful.  |Negative
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  |Negative
It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  |Negative
NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  |Negative
This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  |Negative
Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  |Negative
Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  |Positive
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  |Negative
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  |Negative
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  |Negative
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  |Negative
I mean this in a terrible way.  |Negative
This film has no redeeming features.  |Negative
Everything is appalling.  |Negative
Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  |Negative
The story is beyond stupid.  |Negative
The script iswas there a script?  |Negative
The kids are annoying.  |Negative
The lead man is charisma-free.  |Negative
Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  |Negative
I'll even say it again  this is torture.  |Negative
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  |Negative
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  |Negative
Highly unrecommended.  |Negative
If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  |Negative
Yes, it's that bad.  |Negative
Nothing at all to recommend.  |Negative
An excellent performance from Ms.  |Positive
Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  |Positive
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  |Positive
This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  |Negative
There were too many close ups.  |Negative
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  |Negative
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  |Negative
"You'll love it!  |Positive
This movie is BAD.  |Negative
So bad.  |Negative
The film is way too long.  |Negative
This is definitely one of the bad ones.  |Negative
The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  |Positive
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  |Positive
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  |Positive
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  |Positive
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  |Negative
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  |Negative
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  |Negative
Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  |Negative
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  |Positive
His performance is simply genius.  |Positive
He owns the film, just as Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid owned "Great Balls of Fire.  |Positive
" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  |Positive
Ray Charles is legendary.  |Positive
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  |Positive
Hitchcock is a great director.  |Positive
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  |Negative
Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  |Positive
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  |Negative
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  |Negative
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  |Negative
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  |Negative
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  |Negative
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  |Negative
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  |Negative
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  |Negative
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  |Negative
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  |Negative
When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  |Positive
I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  |Positive
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  |Negative
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  |Negative
The character developments also lacked in depth.  |Negative
Woa, talk about awful.  |Negative
Do not waste your time.  |Negative
It was just too horrible.  |Negative
The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  |Negative
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  |Negative
The poor actors.  |Negative
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  |Negative
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  |Negative
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  |Negative
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  |Positive
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  |Positive
Regrettably, the film fails.  |Negative
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  |Negative
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  |Negative
Yet, I enjoy watching it.  |Positive
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  |Negative
Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  |Negative
The dialogue sucked.  |Negative
The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  |Negative
The soundtrack sucked.  |Negative
The acting sucked.  |Negative
The concert sequences just sucked.  |Negative
That was nice.  |Positive
That was funny.  |Positive
It was so funny.  |Positive
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  |Negative
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  |Negative
I came out of it feeling angry.  |Negative
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  |Positive
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  |Positive
Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  |Positive
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  |Positive
All things considered, a job very well done.  |Positive
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  |Positive
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  |Positive
It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  |Positive
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  |Positive
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  |Positive
Up there with the best of Melville.  |Positive
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  |Positive
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  |Positive
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  |Positive
The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  |Positive
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  |Positive
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  |Negative
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  |Negative
There is a lot of beautiful places.  |Positive
It was forced, like everything in this movie.  |Negative
Again, lame.  |Negative
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  |Negative
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  |Negative
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  |Negative
Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  |Negative
The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  |Negative
The acting was bad.  |Negative
Really bad.  |Negative
Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  |Negative
Camerawork - again, bad.  |Negative
Rating: 1 out of 10.  |Negative
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  |Positive
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  |Positive
He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  |Positive
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  |Positive
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  |Positive
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  |Positive
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  |Positive
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  |Positive
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  |Positive
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  |Positive
I literally vomited while watching this film.  |Negative
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  |Positive
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  |Positive
the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  |Positive
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  |Positive
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  |Positive
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  |Negative
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".  |Negative
To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  |Negative
One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  |Negative
This is such a fun and funny movie.  |Positive
Highly entertaining at all angles.  |Positive
It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  |Positive
So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  |Positive
It even has its sweet moments.  |Positive
The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  |Positive
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  |Positive
And I really did find them funny.  |Positive
This is actually a very smart movie.  |Positive
There is a brilliant twist ending.  |Positive
" I love it.  |Positive
The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  |Positive
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  |Positive
I will never forget it now.  |Positive
It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  |Positive
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  |Negative
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  |Negative
This movie is terrible.  |Negative
The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  |Negative
For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  |Negative
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  |Negative
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  |Negative
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  |Negative
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  |Negative
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  |Negative
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  |Negative
Glad I didn't pay to see it.  |Negative
Didn't laugh or even smile once.  |Negative
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  |Negative
It is a really good show to watch.  |Positive
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  |Positive
Barney is definitely super DE duper.  |Positive
is pretty funny.  |Positive
Babie Bop is very cute.  |Positive
The kids are very cool too.  |Positive
" But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  |Negative
It's just lame.  |Negative
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  |Negative
Everything about this movie is stupid.  |Negative
Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  |Negative
It is shameful.  |Negative
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  |Positive
The writers were "smack on" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  |Positive
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  |Positive
Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  |Positive
I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  |Positive
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  |Positive
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  |Positive
This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  |Positive
Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  |Positive
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  |Positive
Definitely worth checking out.  |Positive
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  |Positive
This movie has a cutting edge to it.  |Positive
I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  |Positive
The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  |Negative
I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  |Negative
It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  |Negative
The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  |Negative
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  |Negative
There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  |Negative
I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  |Negative
If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  |Negative
Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  |Positive
This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  |Positive
I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  |Positive
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  |Negative
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  |Negative
All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  |Negative
God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  |Negative
I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are the excerpts from his works.  |Positive
The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  |Positive
They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  |Positive
The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  |Positive
After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  |Positive
I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  |Positive
Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  |Positive
) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  |Positive
Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick".  |Positive
This is high adventure at its best.  |Positive
I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  |Positive
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  |Positive
(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  |Positive
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  |Negative
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  |Negative
Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  |Negative
Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  |Positive
The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  |Positive
A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  |Positive
For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  |Positive
It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  |Positive
It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  |Positive
It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  |Positive
I rather enjoyed it.  |Positive
I liked it.  |Positive
I couldn't take them seriously.  |Negative
It really created a unique feeling though.  |Positive
Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  |Positive
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  |Positive
Her role was played well.  |Positive
Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  |Positive
The camera really likes her in this movie.  |Positive
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  |Positive
As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  |Positive
I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  |Negative
Even worse than Ticker!  |Negative
& That movie was bad.  |Negative
Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  |Negative
It just blew.  |Negative
This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  |Positive
I just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  |Positive
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  |Negative
This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  |Negative
Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  |Negative
I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  |Negative
The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  |Negative
The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  |Negative
Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  |Negative
I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  |Negative
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  |Negative
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  |Negative
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  |Negative
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  |Negative
An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  |Positive
The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  |Positive
But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  |Negative
Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale.  |Positive
Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  |Negative
Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  |Positive
But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  |Negative
I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  |Negative
The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  |Positive
Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  |Negative
The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  |Negative
I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  |Positive
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  |Positive
My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  |Positive
I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  |Positive
Wow, what a bad film.  |Negative
Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  |Negative
The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  |Negative
Not even good for camp value!  |Negative
I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?  |Negative
You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  |Negative
This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  |Negative
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  |Negative
This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  |Negative
This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  |Negative
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  |Negative
Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  |Negative
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  |Negative
But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  |Negative
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  |Negative
The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  |Negative
Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  |Negative
I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  |Positive
I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  |Positive
A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  |Negative
Even the squibs look awful.  |Negative
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  |Negative
The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  |Negative
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  |Negative
I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  |Negative
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  |Negative
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  |Negative
The directing is sloppy at best.  |Negative
Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  |Negative
Of course, the acting is blah.  |Negative
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  |Negative
And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  |Negative
I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  |Positive
I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  |Positive
This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  |Positive
This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  |Positive
Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  |Positive
Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  |Positive
I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  |Negative
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  |Negative
Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  |Positive
This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  |Positive
But this movie really got to me.  |Positive
See it.  |Positive
I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  |Positive
And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  |Positive
This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  |Positive
I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  |Positive
Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  |Positive
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  |Positive
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  |Positive
I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  |Positive
Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  |Positive
The rest of the cast also play well.  |Positive
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  |Positive
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  |Negative
About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  |Negative
By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  |Negative
What this film lacks is a convincing script.  |Negative
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  |Negative
Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  |Negative
The cast is good.  |Positive
For that, it's worth checking out.  |Positive
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  |Negative
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  |Negative
Everything about it is just bad.  |Negative
I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  |Negative
The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  |Negative
The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  |Negative
Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  |Negative
It is zillion times away from reality.  |Negative
Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  |Negative
Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  |Negative
20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  |Negative
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  |Negative
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  |Negative
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  |Negative
And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  |Negative
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  |Negative
(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  |Negative
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  |Negative
the cast was great.  |Positive
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  |Positive
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  |Positive
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  |Negative
first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  |Negative
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  |Negative
putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.  |Negative
there is no real plot.  |Negative
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  |Negative
STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  |Positive
This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  |Positive
While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  |Positive
However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  |Positive
It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  |Positive
Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  |Positive
The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  |Negative
I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  |Negative
The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  |Positive
John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  |Positive
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  |Negative
This may be the only bad film he ever made.  |Negative
So bad...well...it's just bad.  |Negative
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  |Negative
It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  |Negative
I thought it was bad.  |Negative
Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  |Negative
Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  |Negative
The script is a big flawed mess.  |Negative
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  |Negative
Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  |Negative
The movie is terribly boring in places.  |Negative
The lighting is awful.  |Negative
The film looks cheap and bland.  |Negative
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  |Negative
This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  |Negative
The visual effects were AWFUL.  |Negative
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  |Negative
The "explosion" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  |Negative
Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  |Positive
Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  |Positive
To sum the film up, "Breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  |Negative
Not recommended.  |Negative
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  |Negative
Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  |Negative
I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  |Negative
Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  |Negative
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  |Positive
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  |Negative
The budget was evidently very limited.  |Negative
This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  |Negative
However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  |Negative
Filmiing was less expansive.  |Negative
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  |Negative
Generally; it just lacked imagination.  |Negative
Not recommended.  |Negative
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  |Negative
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  |Negative
Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  |Negative
Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  |Negative
I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  |Negative
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  |Negative
Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  |Positive
But "Tiny Toons" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  |Positive
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  |Positive
Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  |Positive
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  |Positive
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  |Positive
Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  |Negative
Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  |Negative
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  |Positive
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  |Negative
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  |Negative
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  |Negative
To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  |Negative
In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  |Negative
The story line is just awful!  |Negative
It's just painful!  |Negative
And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  |Negative
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  |Negative
Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  |Negative
I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  |Positive
The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  |Positive
Go watch it!  |Positive
Omit watching this.  |Negative
VERY funny!  |Positive
My rating: just 3 out of 10.  |Negative
The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  |Positive
An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  |Positive
Don't miss it.  |Positive
This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  |Positive
A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  |Positive
But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  |Positive
It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  |Positive
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  |Negative
Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  |Negative
Avoid at all costs.  |Negative
I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  |Positive
I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  |Positive
His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  |Positive
I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  |Positive
But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  |Positive
I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  |Positive
I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  |Negative
He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  |Negative
Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  |Positive
Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  |Positive
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  |Positive
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  |Positive
Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  |Positive
But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  |Positive
It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  |Positive
There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  |Positive
The cast is always entertaining as usual.  |Positive
Overall, a delight!  |Positive
This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  |Negative
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  |Negative
The least said about the acting the better.  |Negative
This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  |Positive
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  |Positive
Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  |Positive
The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  |Positive
Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  |Positive
Excellent performance.  |Positive
There still are good actors around!  |Positive
Also great directing and photography.  |Positive
Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  |Positive
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  |Positive
Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  |Positive
If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  |Positive
This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  |Positive
Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  |Positive
However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film "about" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  |Positive
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  |Positive
Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  |Negative
Unless you're just out to visually "collect" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.  |Negative
If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  |Positive
It is not good.  |Negative
Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  |Negative
Then the film just dropped the ball.  |Negative
This is a stunning movie.  |Positive
Raw and sublimely moving.  |Positive
It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  |Positive
All of the main players are mesmerising.  |Positive
Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  |Positive
Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  |Positive
He's a national treasure.  |Positive
GO AND SEE IT!  |Positive
This is an excellent film.  |Positive
The aerial scenes were well-done.  |Positive
It was also the right balance of war and love.  |Positive
The film gives meaning to the phrase, "Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  |Positive
Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  |Positive
A good film by a great director!  |Positive
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  |Positive
There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  |Negative
This is just a great movie.  |Positive
10 out of 10 stars.  |Positive
I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  |Negative
It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  |Negative
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  |Positive
Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.  |Positive
This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  |Positive
I advise you to look out for it.  |Positive
You wont regret it!  |Positive
Highly recommended A+  |Positive
Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  |Negative
It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  |Negative
It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  |Negative
) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  |Negative
It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  |Negative
How awful she is!  |Negative
But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  |Negative
The results, well, are a shame.  |Negative
DELETE this film from your mind!  |Negative
One of the worst shows of all time.  |Negative
The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  |Negative
The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  |Negative
Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  |Negative
Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, "you see kids..." Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  |Negative
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  |Negative
Lame would be the best way to describe it.  |Negative
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  |Positive
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  |Positive
The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  |Positive
Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  |Negative
The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  |Negative
You can find better movies at youtube.  |Negative
Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.  |Negative
A Lassie movie which should have been "put to sleep".... FOREVER.  |Negative
That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  |Negative
So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  |Negative
It isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie.  |Negative
It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  |Negative
Seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.  |Negative
Avoid, avoid, avoid!  |Negative
It will drive you barking mad!  |Negative
The transfers are very good.  |Positive
Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  |Positive
The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  |Positive
) some great music, and terrific scenery.  |Positive
It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!  |Positive
) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  |Positive
The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  |Positive
It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  |Positive
Nothing new there.  |Negative
That was done in the second movie.  |Negative
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  |Negative
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  |Negative
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  |Negative
I just saw this film and I recommend it.  |Positive
It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  |Positive
A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  |Positive
Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  |Positive
Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  |Positive
Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  |Positive
In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  |Positive
Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  |Positive
I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  |Positive
I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  |Positive
The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  |Negative
But I thought his acting was skilled.  |Positive
Meredith M was better than all right.  |Positive
A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  |Positive
It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  |Positive
Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  |Positive
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  |Positive
This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  |Positive
A standout scene.  |Positive
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  |Negative
Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  |Positive
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  |Positive
The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  |Positive
I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  |Positive
This movie is also revealing.  |Positive
Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  |Positive
And it was boring.  |Negative
I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  |Negative
PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  |Positive
It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  |Positive
An Italian reviewer called this "a small, great film," and that's right.  |Positive
All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  |Positive
You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  |Positive
The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" are fascinating.  |Positive
Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  |Positive
You won't forget this movie!  |Positive
Why was this film made?  |Negative
The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  |Negative
The result is a film that just don't look right.  |Negative
None of them are engaging or exciting.  |Negative
The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  |Negative
The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  |Negative
I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was "The Stranger" and I loved it.  |Positive
But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  |Positive
This movie is so awesome!  |Positive
I loved it, it was really scary.  |Positive
I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  |Positive
If you want a real scare rent this one!  |Positive
10/10  |Positive
This is an extraordinary film.  |Positive
As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  |Positive
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  |Positive
The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  |Positive
This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  |Positive
Predictable, but not a bad watch.  |Positive
It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  |Positive
She carries the movie well.  |Positive
Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  |Positive
It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  |Positive
How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  |Negative
In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  |Negative
Avoid at ALL costs!  |Negative
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  |Negative
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  |Negative
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  |Negative
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  |Negative
The worst one of the series.  |Negative
Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  |Positive
When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  |Positive
Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  |Positive
Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  |Positive
This film offers many delights and surprises.  |Positive
When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from "Don Giovanni" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  |Positive
The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  |Positive
You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  |Positive
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  |Positive
The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  |Positive
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  |Positive
The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  |Positive
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  |Positive
Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  |Positive
Conclusion - I loved it.  |Positive
It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  |Positive
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  |Positive
Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  |Positive
It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  |Positive
The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  |Positive
Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  |Positive
Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  |Positive
Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  |Positive
See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  |Positive
See both films if you can.  |Positive
It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella "The Dead.  |Positive
Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  |Positive
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  |Negative
It's very slow.  |Negative
Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  |Negative
) Don't waste your time.  |Negative
End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  |Negative
He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  |Negative
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  |Negative
I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  |Negative
This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  |Positive
It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  |Positive
" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  |Positive
Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  |Positive
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  |Positive
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  |Negative
Lots of holes in the script.  |Negative
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  |Negative
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  |Negative
The dialogue is atrocious.  |Negative
The acting is beyond abysmal.  |Negative
Everything stinks.  |Negative
Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  |Negative
Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  |Negative
It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  |Negative
In short, don't bother with this movie.  |Negative
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  |Positive
The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  |Positive
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  |Positive
The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  |Positive
A film not easily forgotten.  |Positive
But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  |Positive
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  |Positive
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  |Positive
Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  |Positive
Great movie!  |Positive
Also the story and acting were weak.  |Negative
At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  |Negative
Either way, it sucks.  |Negative
The script is horrendously stupid.  |Negative
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  |Negative
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  |Negative
What the hell kind of crap is that?!  |Negative
Then, there's the plot holes.  |Negative
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  |Negative
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  |Positive
She's poised and amazing.  |Positive
Dee Snider just plain sucks.  |Negative
He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  |Negative
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  |Negative
The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  |Negative
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  |Negative
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  |Negative
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  |Negative
Avoid at any and all costs.  |Negative
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  |Negative
Avoid this film at all costs.  |Negative
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  |Negative
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  |Negative
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  |Negative
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  |Negative
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  |Negative
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  |Negative
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  |Negative
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  |Negative
The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  |Positive
The best part about "Nurse Betty" is it's unpredictability.  |Positive
Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  |Positive
Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.  |Negative
This one just fails to create any real suspense.  |Negative
As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  |Negative
There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  |Positive
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  |Negative
One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  |Negative
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  |Negative
Hated it.  |Negative
This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  |Negative
I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  |Negative
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  |Negative
This is not movie-making.  |Negative
The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  |Negative
So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  |Negative
I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  |Positive
I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  |Positive
Excellent short film.  |Positive
Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  |Positive
I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  |Negative
Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  |Negative
The story line is totally predictable.  |Negative
Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  |Positive
I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  |Negative
Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  |Negative
Really awful.  |Negative
Not easy to watch.  |Negative
Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  |Positive
It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  |Positive
Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  |Positive
The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  |Positive
I rate this movie 9/10.  |Positive
I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  |Positive
The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  |Positive
Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in "At Play In The Fields Of The Lord".  |Positive
For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  |Positive
It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  |Positive
The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  |Positive
They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  |Positive
This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  |Positive
The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  |Positive
The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  |Positive
People who like European films and "art movies" will like this movie.  |Positive
This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  |Positive
Go rent it.  |Positive
However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  |Positive
It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  |Positive
Brilliance indeed.  |Positive
But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  |Positive
Think of the film being like a dream.  |Positive
Simply beautiful.  |Positive
Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  |Positive
It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  |Positive
It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  |Positive
Just whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  |Negative
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  |Negative
The movie seemed a little slow at first.  |Negative
But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  |Positive
It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the "gadget".  |Positive
I enjoyed it.  |Positive
I have recommended it to friends.  |Positive
I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  |Positive
Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  |Positive
Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  |Positive
The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  |Positive
The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  |Positive
The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  |Positive
Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  |Positive
Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  |Positive
Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  |Positive
At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  |Positive
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  |Positive
The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  |Positive
If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  |Negative
This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  |Negative
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  |Negative
Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  |Positive
Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  |Positive
Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  |Negative
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  |Positive
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  |Positive
Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  |Positive
I keep watching it over and over.  |Positive
It's a sad movie, but very good.  |Positive
If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  |Positive
She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  |Positive
Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  |Positive
;) Recommend with confidence!  |Positive
This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  |Positive
It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  |Positive
:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  |Positive
The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  |Positive
Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  |Positive
Lange had become a great actress.  |Positive
It looked like a wonderful story.  |Positive
I never walked out of a movie faster.  |Negative
I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  |Negative
Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  |Negative
In a word, it is embarrassing.  |Negative
Exceptionally bad!  |Negative
All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  |Negative
Wow... Loved this place.|Positive
Crust is not good.|Negative
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.|Negative
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.|Positive
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.|Positive
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.|Negative
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)|Negative
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.|Negative
The fries were great too.|Positive
A great touch.|Positive
Service was very prompt.|Positive
Would not go back.|Negative
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.|Negative
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!|Positive
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.|Negative
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.|Negative
Highly recommended.|Positive
Waitress was a little slow in service.|Negative
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.|Negative
did not like at all.|Negative
The Burrittos Blah!|Negative
The food, amazing.|Positive
Service is also cute.|Positive
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.|Positive
So they performed.|Positive
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.|Positive
- They never brought a salad we asked for.|Negative
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.|Positive
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.|Negative
The worst was the salmon sashimi.|Negative
Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.|Positive
This was like the final blow!|Negative
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.|Positive
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.|Negative
Overall, I like this place a lot.|Positive
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.|Positive
Ample portions and good prices.|Positive
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.|Negative
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!|Positive
Service sucks.|Negative
The shrimp tender and moist.|Positive
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.|Negative
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.|Negative
On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.|Positive
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.|Negative
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.|Positive
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.|Negative
The burger is good beef, cooked just right.|Positive
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!|Positive
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.|Positive
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.|Positive
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.|Positive
Their chow mein is so good!|Positive
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.|Negative
The portion was huge!|Positive
Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.|Positive
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.|Negative
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.|Negative
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.|Positive
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.|Negative
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.|Negative
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!|Positive
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.|Positive
We'd definitely go back here again.|Positive
We are so glad we found this place.|Positive
Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.|Positive
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!|Positive
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing|Positive
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.|Negative
A great way to finish a great.|Positive
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.|Positive
- Really, really good rice, all the time.|Positive
The service was meh.|Negative
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.|Negative
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.|Negative
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.|Negative
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !|Negative
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.|Positive
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.|Positive
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.|Negative
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.|Negative
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.|Negative
The turkey and roast beef were bland.|Negative
This place has it!|Positive
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.|Negative
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.|Positive
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.|Negative
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!|Positive
Omelets are to die for!|Positive
Everything was fresh and delicious!|Positive
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.|Negative
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.|Positive
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!|Negative
Best breakfast buffet!!!|Positive
say bye bye to your tip lady!|Negative
We'll never go again.|Negative
Will be back again!|Positive
Food arrived quickly!|Positive
It was not good.|Negative
On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.|Positive
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!|Positive
The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.|Positive
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.|Positive
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.|Positive
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.|Positive
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!|Positive
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!|Positive
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.|Positive
Will go back next trip out.|Positive
Sooooo good!!|Positive
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.|Negative
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.|Negative
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.|Positive
Nice, spicy and tender.|Positive
Good prices.|Positive
Check it out.|Positive
It was pretty gross!|Negative
I've had better atmosphere.|Negative
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.|Negative
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.|Negative
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.|Negative
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.|Negative
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.|Positive
The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.|Positive
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.|Positive
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!|Negative
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...|Negative

Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.|Positive
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.|Negative
Penne vodka excellent!|Positive
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.|Positive
The management is rude.|Negative
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.|Positive

My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.|Negative

Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.|Positive
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.|Positive
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.|Negative
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.|Negative
I give it 2 thumbs down|Negative
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.|Negative
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.|Positive

I was seated immediately.|Positive
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.|Positive
Avoid at all cost!|Negative
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.|Positive
DELICIOUS!!|Positive
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.|Positive
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...|Negative
I've never been treated so bad.|Negative
Bacon is hella salty.|Positive
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.|Negative
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.|Positive
The waitresses are very friendly.|Positive
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!|Positive
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.|Positive
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.|Negative
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.|Negative
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.|Positive
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.|Positive
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.|Negative
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.|Negative
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.|Negative
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!|Negative
It was probably dirt.|Negative
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.|Positive
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.|Positive
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.|Negative
Interesting decor.|Positive
What I really like there is the crepe station.|Positive

you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)|Positive
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.|Positive
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.|Negative

The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.|Negative

The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.|Positive
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.|Negative
For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.|Negative
My friend loved the salmon tartar.|Positive

Soggy and not good.|Negative
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.|Positive
Which are small and not worth the price.|Negative
- the food is rich so order accordingly.|Positive
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!|Negative
The service was a bit lacking.|Negative
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.|Negative
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.|Negative
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.|Negative
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.|Positive
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!|Positive
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.|Positive
As for the "mains," also uninspired.|Negative
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!|Positive

If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.|Negative
Very very fun chef.|Positive
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.|Negative
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.|Positive
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.|Negative
The descriptions said "yum yum sauce" and another said "eel sauce", yet another said "spicy mayo"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.|Negative
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).|Positive
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.|Negative
Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.|Positive
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.|Negative
Now this dish was quite flavourful.|Positive

Owner's are really great people.!|Positive
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.|Negative
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.|Positive
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.|Negative
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.|Positive
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.|Positive
Fantastic service here.|Positive
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.|Negative

I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.|Negative
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.|Positive
Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!|Positive
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.|Positive

Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!|Positive
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.|Negative

The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.|Positive
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.|Negative
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.|Positive
You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.|Positive

Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.|Positive
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.|Negative
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.|Negative
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.|Positive
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.|Positive
All the bread is made in-house!|Positive
The only downside is the service.|Negative
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.|Negative
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.|Positive
A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.|Positive
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!|Positive
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!|Positive

They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.|Positive
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.|Negative
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.|Negative

We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.|Positive

To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.|Positive
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.|Negative
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!|Positive

Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.|Positive
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.|Positive
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.|Negative

We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.|Negative

The manager was the worst.|Negative
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.|Positive

Love the margaritas, too!|Positive
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.|Positive
Very good, though!|Positive
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.|Negative

Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.|Negative
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.|Positive
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.|Positive
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.|Positive
I LOVED it!|Positive
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.|Negative
This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.|Positive
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.|Negative
The selection of food was not the best.|Negative
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!|Positive
This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.|Positive
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.|Positive

How awesome is that.|Positive
I will be back many times soon.|Positive

Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.|Negative

This place is horrible and way overpriced.|Negative
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.|Negative
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.|Negative

But then they came back cold.|Negative
Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.|Negative
The real disappointment was our waiter.|Negative
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.|Negative
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.|Negative
Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.|Negative
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?|Negative

I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.|Negative
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.|Negative
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.|Negative
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.|Negative
Food was below average.|Negative
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.|Negative
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.|Negative
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).|Negative
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.|Negative
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.|Negative
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.|Negative
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.|Negative

Spend your money and time some place else.|Negative
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.|Negative
the presentation of the food was awful.|Negative
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.|Negative
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.|Negative
Appetite instantly gone.|Negative
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.|Negative
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.|Negative
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.|Negative
